## RebuildAmerica

It's time for the takeback of our country. Since COVID, the world has fell into a madness that needs repair. 

Join me in this quest to rebuild from the ground up. 

It's time to try a Trickle-up approach to the world's problems instead of the trickle-down approach. For too long wealth has stayed at the top of society starting at the government and ending not far below that. COVID relief has showed us, politicians are only interested in enriching themselves. By the time relief reaches idividuals, the majority of aid is gone.
